# Hello World: A Deep Dive into Python Security

This is a sample research article to demonstrate the MDX content engine and syntax highlighting capabilities.

## Introduction

When writing your first Python program, security should be a primary consideration, even for something as simple as "Hello World".

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python script that demonstrates basic security practices:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Secure Hello World implementation
"""

import sys
from typing import Optional

def greet(name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Greet a user securely.
    
    Args:
        name: Optional name to greet. If None, uses a default greeting.
    
    Returns:
        A greeting string.
    """
    if name is None:
        return "Hello, World!"
    
    # Sanitize input to prevent injection
    sanitized_name = name.strip()[:100]  # Limit length
    
    if not sanitized_name:
        return "Hello, World!"
    
    return f"Hello, {sanitized_name}!"

def main():
    """Main entry point."""
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        name = sys.argv[1]
    else:
        name = None
    
    greeting = greet(name)
    print(greeting)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Length Limits**: Prevent buffer overflow attacks by limiting input length
3. **Type Hints**: Use type hints for better code safety

## Conclusion

Even simple programs should consider security from the start. This foundation will help you build more secure applications as your projects grow in complexity.
